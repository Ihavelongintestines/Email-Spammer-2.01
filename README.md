# Email-Spammer-2.01
Updated version of my previous email spammer.
Steps:
1. Download and extract zip file
2. Compile the .py file with pyinstaller
3. Run .exe file (it should be in a folder called dist)
4. Enter your email, your password, app password, and target email

How to use pyinstaller: 
1. Type pip install pyinstaller into cmd. If this doesn't work and it says some stuff about "ssl" try: pip install --trusted-host=pypi.org --trusted-host=files.pythonhosted.org --user pyinstaller
2. Open cmd
3. Type: cd path\to\your\folder
4. Now that cmd is in the same folder type: pyinstaller --onefile Main.py

One final thing before you make your targets inbox unusable:
I will not be held responsible for what ever this code is used for.
